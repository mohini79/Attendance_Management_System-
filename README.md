# Attendance_Management_System-
Attendence Management System using Face Recognition is a Biometric technology that uses artificial intelligence to identify and verify individuals based on their facial characteristics. It can be used in companies to track employee attendence and in colleges to mark student attendance.
# Scope of the project 
The scope of the proposed attendance system using Haar Cascade and LBPH face recognition algorithms encompasses several key components. Firstly, the project will involve the development and implementation of software capable of capturing, processing, and recognizing faces in real-time using the Haar Cascade and LBPH algorithms. This software will be designed to integrate seamlessly with existing attendance management systems or operate as a standalone solution. Additionally, the project will include the design and deployment of a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage attendance records, view reports, and configure system settings. The system will be tested rigorously to evaluate its accuracy, efficiency, and reliability under various environmental conditions and with diverse user demographics. Furthermore, the scope extends to documentation encompassing user manuals, technical specifications, and guidelines for system maintenance and troubleshooting. Lastly, the project will consider scalability and potential future enhancements, such as incorporating advanced machine learning techniques or integrating with biometric authentication systems for enhanced security.
